# Feeding the Inflation: How Food Prices Shape Economies

This is the final project prototype for CSC316, developed by **Team Brunch Baddies** (Ayanaa Rahman, Ayush Sahi, and Dana Al Shekerchi). The project analyzes food price inflation data and provides interactive visualizations using D3.js. The prototype includes several visualizations, such as a time-series chart, a bar chart of price volatility, and an innovative interactive view featuring focus+context brushing.

  - **Visualization 2:** Price Volatility in Key Food Categories (bar chart)
  - **Visualization 3:** Interactive/Innovative View (multi-line or focus+context view with brushing)

- **Modern & Responsive Design:**  
  The web interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using responsive design principles and modular ES6 classes for better code organization.

- **Focus+Context Interaction:**  
  Brushing in the context view allows users to zoom in on specific time ranges in the focus view.
